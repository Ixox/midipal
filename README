This MidiPal firmware has been modified to support MidiBud push buttons.

Changes:

* Pressing a button usually selects one of the first four app parameter pages,
  with following exceptions:
* In User Program pressing a button selects one of the four user programs
* In SH-01 sequencer recording mode pressing button 1 inserts rest, button 2 a tie,
  button 3 stops recording and button 4 stops recording and starts playback
* No Controller app (MidiBud does not have analogue inputs)
